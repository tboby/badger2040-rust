//! # rp2040-tickv
//!
//! TicKV (Tiny Circular Key Value) is a small file system allowing
//! key value pairs to be stored in Flash Memory.  This is an implementation
//! of TicKV for RP2040 hardware that utilizes leftover space at the end
//! of flash memory for persistent key:value storage.
//!
//! You can learn more about TicKV here:
//! [TicKV](https://docs.tockos.org/tickv/index.html]).
//!
//! For this code to work properly (for now) you'll need to ensure that you have:
//!
//! `lto = 'fat'` or `lto = 'thin'`
//!
//! ...in your Cargo.toml under `[profile.release]` and similar sections (e.g. `dev-`).
//!
//! When implementing this you'll need to choose a hashing function for TicKV to use.
//! For this I recommend [SipHasher](https://crates.io/crates/siphasher).  See the
//! `basic_read_write.rs` example for how to use it with TicKV.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! The longest key/value (combined) that can be stored is 4079 bytes. This is because
//! the RP2040 uses flash chips that have 4096 byte sectors (the minimum amount that
//! can be erased) and TicKV has a header overhead of 17 bytes.
//!
//! # Considerations
//!
//! You'll need to call `tickv.garbage_collect()` in your code from time to time after
//! you've marked keys as invalid or TicKV won't consider that space as "free".  A
//! simple way to handle this is to just collect garbage somewhere in your `init()`
//! function and/or after a certain number of keys have been marked invalid (depending
//! on how much storage you're using and how big the values are).
//!
//! Note that calling `tickv.garbage_collect()` is a relatively safe and low-overhead
//! operation if nothing has changed and only pauses interrupts briefly if it has to
//! perform erase (cleanup) operations.  So it's probably not a big deal if you run
//! it inside of a very long timer (say, once an hour).  The longer you go between
//! garbage collections the longer it could take though (it's one of those things).
//!
//! Ultimately though, it's up to you to figure out when to call it since it's highly
//! dependent on the application.  How long erasure takes is also highly dependent on
//! your hardware.  So do some testing and make some guesses 👍

that data back using something like `slice::from_raw_parts()` you
